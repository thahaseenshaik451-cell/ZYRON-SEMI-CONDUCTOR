    "reasoning": "This Firestore data structure is designed to support Zyron Semiconductors' website, focusing on showcasing services, capturing contact form submissions, and managing homepage content. It emphasizes security, scalability, and maintainability by adhering to the principles of Authorization Independence, Clarity of Intent, DBAC (Database-Based Access Control), and Rules are not Filters (QAPs). \n\nAuthorization Independence is achieved by avoiding hierarchical authorization dependencies (`get()` calls in security rules). Since there are no user-specific documents requiring role-based access, Authorization Independence is inherent to the structure.\n\nStructural Segregation is applied by storing different data types (contact form submissions, services, homepage sections) in separate top-level collections, each with its own security rules.\n\nAccess Modeling uses path-based ownership where applicable. The admin panel accesses all data, and since all collections are top-level, no membership maps are required.\n\nQAPs are supported because each collection is homogeneous and has simple rules based on the admin role. There are no list operations restricted by user roles. Admins have read and write access to all collections, thus QAPs are satisfied.\n\nThe design includes separate collections for ContactFormSubmissions, Services, and HomepageSections. This segregation allows for simple and robust security rules. The admin role can be managed using the `/roles_admin/{uid}` collection, granting full access to manage the website's content and inquiries."
